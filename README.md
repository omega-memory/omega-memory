## The Problem

AI coding agents are stateless. Every new session starts from zero.

- **Context loss.** Agents forget every decision, preference, and architectural choice between sessions. Developers spend 10-30 minutes per session re-explaining context that was already established.
- **Repeated mistakes.** Without learning from past sessions, agents make the same errors over and over. They don't remember what worked, what failed, or why a particular approach was chosen.

OMEGA gives AI coding agents long-term memory and cross-session learning, all running locally on your machine.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install omega-memory    # install from PyPI
omega setup                 # auto-configures Claude Code + hooks
omega doctor                # verify everything works
```

That's it. Start a new Claude Code session and say **"Remember that we always use early returns and never nest more than 2 levels."** Close the session. Open a new one and ask **"What are my code style preferences?"** OMEGA recalls it instantly.

**Full architecture walkthrough and setup guide:** [omegamax.co/quickstart](https://omegamax.co/quickstart)

**Using Cursor, Windsurf, or Zed?**

```bash
omega setup --client cursor          # writes ~/.cursor/mcp.json
omega setup --client windsurf        # writes ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
omega setup --client zed             # writes ~/.config/zed/settings.json
```

## What Happens Next

After `omega setup`, OMEGA works in the background. No commands to learn.

**Auto-capture** — When you make a decision or debug an issue, OMEGA detects it and stores it automatically.

**Auto-surface** — When you edit a file or start a session, OMEGA surfaces relevant memories from past sessions — even ones you forgot about.

**Checkpoint & resume** — Stop mid-task, pick up in a new session exactly where you left off.

You can also explicitly tell Claude to remember things:

> "Remember that we use JWT tokens, not session cookies"

But the real value is what OMEGA does without being asked.

## Examples

### Architectural Decisions

> "Remember: we chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for the orders service because we need ACID transactions for payment processing."

Three weeks later, in a new session:

> "I'm adding a caching layer to the orders service — what should I know?"

OMEGA surfaces the PostgreSQL decision automatically, so Claude doesn't suggest a MongoDB-style approach.

### Learning from Mistakes

You spend 30 minutes debugging a Docker build failure. Claude figures it out:

> *"The node_modules volume mount was shadowing the container's node_modules. Fixed by adding an anonymous volume."*

OMEGA auto-captures this as a lesson. Next time anyone hits the same Docker issue, Claude already knows the fix.

### Code Preferences

> "Remember: always use early returns. Never nest conditionals more than 2 levels deep. Prefer `const` over `let`."

Every future session follows these rules without being told again.

### Task Continuity

You're mid-refactor when you need to stop:

> "Checkpoint this — I'm halfway through migrating the auth middleware to the new pattern."

Next session:

> "Resume the auth middleware task."

Claude picks up exactly where you left off — files changed, decisions made, what's left to do.

### Error Patterns

Claude encounters the same `ECONNRESET` three sessions in a row. Each time OMEGA surfaces the previous fix:

```
[error_pattern] ECONNRESET on API calls — caused by connection pool exhaustion.
Fix: set maxSockets to 50 in the http agent config.
Accessed 3 times
```

No more re-debugging the same issue.

## Key Features

- **Auto-Capture & Surfacing** — Hook system automatically captures decisions and lessons, and surfaces relevant memories before edits, at session start, and during work.

- **Persistent Memory** — Stores decisions, lessons, error patterns, and preferences with semantic search. Your agent recalls what matters without you re-explaining everything each session.

- **Semantic Search** — bge-small-en-v1.5 embeddings + sqlite-vec for fast, accurate retrieval. Finds relevant memories even when the wording is different.

- **Cross-Session Learning** — Lessons, preferences, and error patterns accumulate over time. Agents learn from past mistakes and build on previous decisions.

- **Forgetting Intelligence** — Memories decay naturally over time, conflicts auto-resolve, and every deletion is audited. Preferences and error patterns are exempt from decay.

- **Graph Relationships** — Memories are linked with typed edges (related, supersedes, contradicts). Traverse the knowledge graph to find connected context.

- **Encryption at Rest** *(optional)* — AES-256-GCM encrypted storage with macOS Keychain integration. `pip install omega-memory[encrypt]`

- **Plugin Architecture** — Extensible via entry points. Add custom tools and handlers through the plugin system.

## How OMEGA Compares

| Feature | OMEGA | MEMORY.md | Mem0 | Basic MCP Memory |
|---------|:-----:|:---------:|:----:|:----------------:|
| Persistent across sessions | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Semantic search | Yes | No (file grep only) | Yes | Varies |
| Auto-capture (no manual effort) | Yes | No (manual edits) | Yes (cloud) | No |
| Contradiction detection | Yes | No | No | No |
| Checkpoint & resume tasks | Yes | No | No | No |
| Graph relationships | Yes | No | No | No |
| Cross-session learning | Yes | Limited | Yes | No |
| Intelligent forgetting | Yes | No (grows forever) | No | No |
| Local-only (no cloud/API keys) | Yes | Yes | No (API key required) | Yes |
| Setup complexity | `pip install` + `omega setup` | Zero (built-in) | API key + cloud config | Manual JSON config |

**MEMORY.md** is Claude Code's built-in markdown file -- great for simple notes, but no search, no auto-capture, and it grows unbounded. **Mem0** offers strong semantic memory but requires cloud API keys and has no checkpoint/resume or contradiction detection. **Basic MCP memory servers** (e.g., simple key-value stores) provide persistence but lack the intelligence layer -- no semantic search, no forgetting, no graph.

OMEGA gives you the best of all worlds: fully local, zero cloud dependencies, with intelligent features that go far beyond simple storage.

## Benchmark

OMEGA scores **95.4% task-averaged** on [LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) (ICLR 2025), an academic benchmark that tests long-term memory across 5 categories: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and preference tracking. Raw accuracy is 466/500 (93.2%). Task-averaged scoring (mean of per-category accuracies) is the standard methodology used by other systems on the leaderboard. This is the **#1 score on the leaderboard**.

| System | Score | Notes |
|--------|------:|-------|
| **OMEGA** | **95.4%** | **#1** |
| Mastra | 94.87% | #2 |
| Emergence | 86.0% | — |
| Zep/Graphiti | 71.2% | Published in their paper |

## Compatibility

| Client | 12 MCP Tools | Auto-Capture Hooks | Setup Command |
|--------|:------------:|:------------------:|---------------|
| Claude Code | Yes | Yes | `omega setup` |
| Cursor | Yes | No | `omega setup --client cursor` |
| Windsurf | Yes | No | `omega setup --client windsurf` |
| Zed | Yes | No | `omega setup --client zed` |
| Any MCP Client | Yes | No | Manual config (see docs) |

All clients get full access to all 12 core memory tools. Auto-capture hooks (automatic memory surfacing and context capture) require Claude Code.

Requires Python 3.11+. macOS and Linux supported. Windows via WSL.

## Remote / SSH Setup

Claude Code's SSH support lets you run your agent on a remote server from any device. OMEGA makes that server **remember everything** across sessions and reconnections.

```bash
# On your remote server (any Linux VPS — no GPU needed)
pip install omega-memory
omega setup
omega doctor
```

That's it. Every SSH session — from your laptop, phone, or tablet — now has full memory of every previous session on that server.

**Why this matters:**

- **Device-agnostic memory** — SSH in from any device, OMEGA's memory graph is on the server waiting for you
- **Survives disconnects** — SSH drops? Reconnect and `omega_resume_task` picks up exactly where you left off
- **Always-on accumulation** — A cloud VM running 24/7 means your memory graph grows continuously
- **Team-ready** — Multiple developers SSH to the same server? OMEGA tracks who's working on what with file claims, handoff notes, and peer messaging

**Requirements:** Any VPS with Python 3.11+ (~337 MB RAM after first query). SQLite + CPU-only ONNX embeddings — zero external services.

### CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `omega setup` | Create dirs, download model, register MCP, install hooks |
| `omega doctor` | Verify installation health |
| `omega status` | Memory count, store size, model status |
| `omega query <text>` | Search memories by semantic similarity |

### Hooks

All hooks dispatch via `fast_hook.py` → daemon UDS socket, with fail-open semantics.

| Hook | Handlers | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| SessionStart | `session_start` | Welcome briefing with recent memories |
| Stop | `session_stop` | Session summary |
| UserPromptSubmit | `auto_capture` | Auto-capture lessons/decisions |
| PostToolUse | `surface_memories` | Surface relevant memories during work |

### Storage

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.omega/omega.db` | SQLite database (memories, embeddings, edges) |
| `~/.omega/profile.json` | User profile |
| `~/.omega/hooks.log` | Hook error log |
| `~/.cache/omega/models/bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx/` | ONNX embedding model |

### Search Pipeline

1. **Vector similarity** via sqlite-vec (cosine distance, 384-dim bge-small-en-v1.5)
2. **Full-text search** via FTS5 (fast keyword matching)
3. **Type-weighted scoring** (decisions/lessons weighted 2x)
4. **Contextual re-ranking** (boosts by tag, project, and content match)
5. **Deduplication** at query time
6. **Time-decay weighting** (old unaccessed memories rank lower)

### Memory Lifecycle

- **Dedup**: SHA256 hash (exact) + embedding similarity 0.85+ (semantic) + Jaccard per-type
- **Evolution**: Similar content (55-95%) appends new insights to existing memories
- **TTL**: Session summaries expire after 1 day, lessons/preferences are permanent
- **Auto-relate**: Creates `related` edges (similarity >= 0.45) to top-3 similar memories
- **Compaction**: Clusters and summarizes related memories
- **Decay**: Unaccessed memories lose ranking weight over time (floor 0.35); preferences and errors exempt
- **Conflict detection**: Contradicting memories auto-detected on store; decisions auto-resolve, lessons flagged

### Memory Footprint

- Startup: ~31 MB RSS
- After first query (ONNX model loaded): ~337 MB RSS
- Database: ~10.5 MB for ~242 memories

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omega-memory/omega-memory.git
cd core
pip install -e ".[dev]"
omega setup
```

`omega setup` will:
1. Create `~/.omega/` directory
2. Download the ONNX embedding model (~90 MB) to `~/.cache/omega/models/`
3. Register `omega-memory` as an MCP server in `~/.claude.json`
4. Install session hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
5. Add a managed `<!-- OMEGA:BEGIN -->` block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

All changes are idempotent — running `omega setup` again won't duplicate entries.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

**`omega doctor` shows FAIL on import:**
- Ensure `pip install -e .` from the repo root
- Check `python3 -c "import omega"` works

**MCP server not registered:**
```bash
claude mcp add omega-memory -- python3 -m omega.server.mcp_server
```

**Hooks not firing:**
- Check `~/.claude/settings.json` has OMEGA hook entries
- Check `~/.omega/hooks.log` for errors

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/
ruff check src/              # Lint
```

## Uninstall

```bash
claude mcp remove omega-memory
rm -rf ~/.omega ~/.cache/omega
pip uninstall omega-memory
```

Manually remove OMEGA entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` and the `<!-- OMEGA:BEGIN -->` block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
